## Features Used
- Average Monthly Inflow
- Income Volatility Score
- Seasonality Score
- Geo Stability Score
- Device Consistency Score

## Model Used
Random Forest Classifier

## How to Run

2. Run:
   python shadow_income_model.py

## Business Concept

based on alternative income stability metrics instead of
traditional salary slips.

Future Scope:
- API deployment
- Real-time scoring
